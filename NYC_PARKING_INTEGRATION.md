# NYC Parking Regulations Integration

## Overview

Your Prk app now integrates with the **official NYC Open Data Parking Regulation API**, providing users with real-time, accurate parking sign data from the NYC Department of Transportation.

**Data Source**: [NYC Open Data - Parking Regulation Locations and Signs](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Parking-Regulation-Locations-and-Signs/nfid-uabd)

## What This Adds

### ✅ **Real-Time NYC Parking Data**

When users park in New York City, the app automatically:
1. **Detects NYC location** (by coordinates or city name)
2. **Fetches official parking signs** within 200 meters
3. **Parses parking regulations** from over 1 million NYC signs
4. **Categorizes alerts** automatically
5. **Extracts time ranges** (e.g., "8AM-6PM")
6. **Extracts days of week** (e.g., "Monday-Friday")
7. **Shows street names and sides**
8. **Provides actionable information**

### 🚨 **Intelligent Alert Detection**

The service automatically categorizes NYC parking signs into:

| Alert Type | Examples | Icon |
|------------|----------|------|
| **No Parking** | "NO PARKING", "NO STOPPING" | 🚫 |
| **Street Cleaning** | "STREET CLEANING", "SWEEPING" | 🧹 |
| **Metered** | "METER", "MUNI-METER" | 💰 |
| **Time Limited** | "2-HOUR PARKING", "30 MIN" | ⏱️ |
| **Permit Only** | "PERMIT", "AUTHORIZED" | 🎫 |
| **Snow Emergency** | "SNOW EMERGENCY" | ❄️ |
| **Commercial** | "COMMERCIAL", "LOADING" | 🚚 |

## How It Works

### Automatic Detection

The app automatically uses NYC data when:
- Coordinates are within NYC boundaries (40.4774°N to 40.9176°N, -74.2591°W to -73.7004°W)
- City name includes "New York"
- Falls back to OpenStreetMap for other cities

### Data Flow

```
User parks in NYC
    ↓
NYCParkingService detects location
    ↓
Queries NYC Open Data API with coordinates
    ↓
Parses parking signs using intelligent text analysis
    ↓
Creates ParkingAlert objects with categorized types
    ↓
Displays in app with emojis, times, and street info
```

### API Query Example

```dart
final alerts = await NYCParkingService.instance.getParkingRegulations(
  latitude: 40.7589,  // Times Square
  longitude: -73.9851,
  radiusMeters: 200,   // Search within 200 meters
);
```

Returns:
```dart
[
  ParkingAlert(
    type: ParkingAlertType.streetCleaning,
    title: 'Street Cleaning',
    description: 'No parking during street cleaning on 42nd Street (north side)',
    timeRange: '8AM-10AM',
    dayOfWeek: 'Monday-Friday',
    source: 'NYC DOT',
  ),
  ParkingAlert(
    type: ParkingAlertType.meteredParking,
    title: 'Metered Parking',
    description: 'Payment required at meter on Broadway',
    timeRange: '9AM-7PM',
  ),
]
```

## Smart Text Parsing

The service intelligently extracts information from sign text:

### Time Range Extraction
- ✅ "8AM-6PM" → Shows in app
- ✅ "8:00 AM - 6:00 PM" → Normalized
- ✅ "9AM TO 5PM" → Extracted
- ✅ "EXCEPT SUNDAYS" → Shown as time restriction

### Day Extraction
- ✅ Single days: "MONDAY" → "Monday"
- ✅ Ranges: "MON-FRI" → "Monday-Friday"
- ✅ Exceptions: "EXCEPT SUNDAY" → "Monday-Saturday"

### Hour Limits
- ✅ "2 HOUR PARKING" → "2-Hour Limit"
- ✅ "30 MIN" → "30-Minute Limit"

### Location Context
- ✅ Street name added to description
- ✅ Side of street ("north side", "east side", etc.)
- ✅ Consolidates duplicate signs

## Usage in Your App

### Already Integrated! ✅

The NYC service is automatically used when:
- User saves a parking spot in NYC
- App detects NYC coordinates
- Alerts are fetched with priority over other sources

### In Code

```dart
// Automatically happens in ParkingAlertsService
final alertsResponse = await ParkingAlertsService.instance.getParkingAlerts(
  latitude,
  longitude,
);

// NYC data takes priority when in NYC
// Falls back to OpenStreetMap for other cities
```

### What Users See

**On Home Screen:**
- Orange alert card with NYC parking rules
- Emoji indicators for each restriction
- Time ranges (e.g., "8AM-10AM")
- Day information (e.g., "Monday-Friday")

**Example Display:**
```
